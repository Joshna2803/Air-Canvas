# Air-Canvas
The system captures real-time video feed using OpenCV, detects hand landmarks with MediaPipe, and tracks gestures like the index fingertip for drawing or erasing on a NumPy-based canvas, overlaying results on the video. OpenCV's cv2.imshow() displays the updated frame with real-time gesture-based interactions.
